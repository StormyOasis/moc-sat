I was recently reminded of this project I did back in my models of computation class in undergrad. It was a case study analysis on using DNA self assembly to solve NP-Complete problems (Specifically the SAT problem here) in polynomial time.

I had a blast doing it and wanted to put it up here for posterity and safe-keeping. So it doesn't get lost when I accidently reformat the wrong hard-drive....again....

### Note: This is in absolutly NO WAY my research. I was not even tangentially related to any aspect. I had absolutly nothing to do with it at all. The people who did it are WAYYYYY smarter than me. ###

Note 2: The code is hilariously outdated (We're talking Borland / OWL)
